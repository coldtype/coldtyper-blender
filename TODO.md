- Control to stagger letters in a given dimension (to create stair-case effect), though this probably needs to be part of the "export glyphs" functionality for simplicity's sake

- Control to emboss letters (would require two extrusion controls)

- Control to export "layers" of a color font (unstyled?), with option to stagger them in a certain dimension, so a layered color font is automatically a 3d font
